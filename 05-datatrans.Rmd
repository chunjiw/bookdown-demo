### 5.2.4 Exercises
1. Find all flights that
    1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
        ```{r}
        filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
        ```
    2. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
        ```{r}
        filter(flights, dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))
        ```
    3. Were operated by United, American, or Delta
    4. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    5. Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
    6. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
    7. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)



5.3.1.1 How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na()`).

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, !is.na(x), x)
```

5.6.7.2

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)
not_cancelled %>% group_by(tailnum) %>% summarize(n = sum(distance))
```
